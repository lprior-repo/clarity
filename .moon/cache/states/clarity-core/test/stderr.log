    ... required by package `rusqlite v0.32.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `rusqlite = "^0.32"` of package `clarity-core v0.1.0-dev (/home/lewis/src/clarity/clarity-core)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `clarity-core` (locked to 0.1.0-dev) of package `clarity-client v0.1.0-dev (/home/lewis/src/clarity/clarity-client)`
versions that meet the requirements `^0.30.0` are: 0.30.1, 0.30.0

package `libsqlite3-sys` links to the native library `sqlite3`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `sqlite3` as well:
package `libsqlite3-sys v0.27.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `libsqlite3-sys = "^0.27.0"` of package `rusqlite v0.30.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `rusqlite = "^0.30"` of package `deadpool-sqlite v0.7.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `deadpool-sqlite = "^0.7"` of package `clarity-core v0.1.0-dev (/home/lewis/src/clarity/clarity-core)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `clarity-core` (locked to 0.1.0-dev) of package `clarity-client v0.1.0-dev (/home/lewis/src/clarity/clarity-client)`
Only one package in the dependency graph may specify the same links value. This helps ensure that only one copy of a native library is linked in the final binary. Try to adjust your dependencies so that only one package uses the `links = "sqlite3"` value. For more information, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#links.
