  "prompt": "# Simple Implementation Workflow\n\nWork through ALL beads in repository systematically by writing code directly.\nSkip the complex 15-phase tdd15 workflow - just implement functionality.\n\nFor each bead:\n1. Read bead specification from database\n2. Write functional Rust code following AGENTS.md\n3. Implement the feature with zero-unwrap philosophy\n4. Move to next bead when READY_FOR_NEXT_TASK said\n5. Continue until ALL 42 beads are completed\n\nThe beads are organized as:\n- Foundation beads (bd-1ft, bd-2if, bd-3vg, bd-26p, bd-1ib, bd-3s0, bd-2b3)\n- Core beads (bd-2nx, bd-57v, bd-1v2, bd-dws, bd-2yt, bd-264, bd-3ey, bd-2fg, bd-4h9, bd-2lb, bd-3ki, bd-3ue, bd-ezl, bd-1my)\n- Web beads (bd-21h, bd-1bc, bd-z11, bd-2cg, bd-4pq, bd-3rr, bd-84g, bd-w5a, bd-1r8, bd-3n6, bd-3j3, bd-ccj, bd-3tq, bd-34e, bd-2j4, bd-4a6, bd-2pj, bd-10g, bd-19o)\n\n**COMPLETED:**\n- bd-2ck: Set up Rust workspace\n- bd-di8: Test infrastructure setup\n\nUse completion promise \"ALL BEADS COMPLETED\" when done.\n\n**CRITICAL: Write PURELY FUNCTIONAL RUST code. No mutation, no mutable references, no reference mutation. Everything must be immutable. Use Result types and explicit error handling.**\n",
